<p style="margin-top:0px;">&nbsp;</p>

You can create a Channel API support request by filling [this form](https://apisupport.bookingsync.com/get-some-help-from-our-channel-api-support-team) to create a ticket or directly from Slack in the dedicated channel you have with Smily.

Please only submit your request through one of those channels.

To submit your request by Slack, simply proceed by following these steps: ‚úçÔ∏è:

1. Write **/support** in the message area in the Slack channel.

2. Click on the support Request channel API which appears:

7. Someone from the Smily team will mark the request as **acknowledged** and you will be tagged on the thread for follow up:

    [![acknowledged](/images/support/image3.png "acknowledged")](/images/support/image3.png)

    The acknowledged button is to be clicked by the Smily team. In case you have clicked on it by accident, just submit another support form.

8. That‚Äôs it! Our support team will take it from there and will keep you informed in the thread of the resolution of the issue. ü•≥
