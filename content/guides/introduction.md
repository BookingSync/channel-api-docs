## Preface

This API was developed to make integration with our partners easier. If you want to look at all features of our system, please refer to [BookingSync Universe API ](https://developers.bookingsync.com/). The API is fully [JSONAPI 1.0 compliant](http://jsonapi.org).

## How It Works

TODO:

If you have an own website and want to publish rentals ... You can use our API.

Just contact us, we will create an application. And PM's who want to publish their rentals on your website could install this application. You will have access to API to get accounts, who installed your application and you can sign contracts with them, get details of their rentals, check availability, get costs, and book them.
